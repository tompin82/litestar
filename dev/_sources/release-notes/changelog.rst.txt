        has been added.

.. changelog:: 2.0.0beta3
    :date: 2023/07/20

    .. change:: SQLAlchemyDTO: column/relationship type inference
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1879
        :issue: 1853

        If type annotations aren't available for a given column/relationship, they may
        be inferred from the mapped object.

        For columns, the :attr:`~sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.ReflectedColumn.type`\ 's
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine.python_type` will be used as the type of the
        column, and the :attr:`~sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.ReflectedColumn.nullable`
        property to determine if the field should have a :obj:`None` union.

        For relationships, where the ``RelationshipProperty.direction`` is
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.orm.RelationshipDirection.ONETOMANY` or
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.orm.RelationshipDirection.MANYTOMANY`,
        ``RelationshipProperty.collection_class`` and
        ``RelationshipProperty.mapper.class_`` are used to construct an annotation for
        the collection.

        For one-to-one relationships, ``RelationshipProperty.mapper.class_`` is used to
        get the type annotation, and will be made a union with :obj:`None` if all of the
        foreign key columns are nullable.

    .. change:: DTO: Piccolo ORM
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1896

        Add support for piccolo ORM with the
        :class:`~litestar.contrib.piccolo.PiccoloDTO`.

    .. change:: OpenAPI: Allow setting ``OpenAPIController.path`` from ```OpenAPIConfig``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1886

        :attr:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIConfig.path` has been added, which can be used
        to set the ``path`` for :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIController` directly,
        without needing to create a custom instance of it.

        If ``path`` is set in both :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIConfig` and
        :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIController`, the path set on the controller
        will take precedence.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: ``auto_commit``, ``auto_expunge`` and ``auto_refresh`` options
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1900

        .. currentmodule:: litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository

        Three new parameters have been added to the repository and various methods:

        ``auto_commit``
            When this :obj:`True`, the session will
            :meth:`~sqlalchemy.orm.Session.commit` instead of
            :meth:`~sqlalchemy.orm.Session.flush` before returning.

            Available in:

            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.add`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.add_many`

            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.update_many`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.upsert`

            (and their sync equivalents)

        ``auto_refresh``
            When :obj:`True`, the session will execute
            :meth:`~sqlalchemy.orm.Session.refresh` objects before returning.

            Available in:

            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.add`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.get_or_create`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.update`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.upsert`

            (and their sync equivalents)


        ``auto_expunge``
            When this is :obj:`True`, the session will execute
            :meth:`~sqlalchemy.orm.Session.expunge` all objects before returning.

            Available in:

            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.add`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.add_many`

            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.get_or_create`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.update`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.update_many`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.list`
            - :meth:`~SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.upsert`

            (and their sync equivalents)

    .. change:: Include path name in ``ImproperlyConfiguredException`` message for missing param types
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1935

        The message of a :exc:`ImproperlyConfiguredException` raised when a path
        parameter is missing a type now contains the name of the path.

    .. change:: DTO: New ``include`` parameter added to ``DTOConfig``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1950

        :attr:`~litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig.include` has been added to
        :class:`~litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig`, providing a counterpart to
        :attr:`~litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig.exclude`.

        If ``include`` is provided, only those fields specified within it will be
        included.

    .. change:: ``AbstractDTOFactory`` moved to ``dto.factory.base``
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1950

        :class:`~litestar.dto.base_factory.AbstractDTOFactory` has moved from
        ``litestar.dto.factory.abc`` to ``litestar.dto.factory.base``.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Rename ``_sentinel`` column to ``sa_orm_sentinel``
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1933


        The ``_sentinel`` column of
        :class:`~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.UUIDPrimaryKey` has been renamed to
        ``sa_orm_sentinel``, to support Spanner, which does not support tables starting
        with ``_``.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Fix audit columns defaulting to app startup time
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1894

        A bug was fixed where
        :attr:`~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.AuditColumns.created_at` and
        :attr:`~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.AuditColumns.updated_at` would default
        to the :class:`~datetime.datetime` at initialization time, instead of the time
        of the update.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemyDTO: Fix handling of ``Sequence`` with defaults
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1883
        :issue: 1851

        Fixes handling of columns defined with
        `Sequence <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/defaults.html#defining-sequences>`_
        default values.

        The SQLAlchemy default value for a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column` will be
        ignored when it is a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Sequence` object. This is
        because the SQLAlchemy sequence types represent server generated values, and
        there is no way for us to generate a reasonable default value for that field
        from it without making a database query, which is not possible deserialization.

    .. change:: Allow JSON as redirect response
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1908

        Enables using redirect responses with a JSON media type.

    .. change:: DTO / OpenAPI: Fix detection of required fields for Pydantic and msgspec DTOs
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1946

        A bug was fixed that would lead to fields of a Pydantic model or msgspec Structs
        being marked as "not required" in the generated OpenAPI schema when used with
        DTOs.

    .. change:: Replace ``Header``, ``CacheControlHeader`` and ``ETag`` Pydantic models with dataclasses
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1917
        :breaking:

        As part of the removal of Pydantic as a hard dependency, the header models
        :class:`~litestar.datastructures.Header`,
        :class:`~litestar.datastructures.CacheControlHeader` and
        :class:`~litestar.datastructures.ETag` have been replaced with dataclasses.


        .. note::
            Although marked breaking, this change should not affect usage unless you
            relied on these being Pydantic models in some way.

    .. change:: Pydantic as an optional dependency
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1963
        :type: misc

        As of this release, Pydantic is no longer a required dependency of Litestar.
        It is still supported in the same capacity as before, but Litestar itself does
        not depend on it anymore in its internals.

    .. change:: Pydantic 2 support
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1956

        Pydantic 2 is now supported alongside Pydantic 1.

    .. change:: Deprecation of  ``partial`` module
        :type: misc
        :pr: 2002

        The ``litestar.partial`` and ``litestar.partial.Partial`` have been
        deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Users are advised to upgrade
        to DTOs, making use of the :class:`~litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig` option
        ``partial=True``.


.. changelog:: 2.0.0beta2
    :date: 2023/06/24

    .. change:: Support ``annotated-types``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1847

        Extended support for the
        `annotated-types <https://pypi.org/project/annotated-types>`_ library is now
        available.

    .. change:: Increased verbosity of validation error response keys
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1774
        :breaking:

        The keys in validation error responses now include the full path to the field
        where the originated.

        An optional ``source`` key has been added, signifying whether the value is from
        the body, a cookie, a header, or a query param.

        .. code-block:: json
            :caption: before

            {
              "status_code": 400,

                {"key": "int_cookie", "message": "value is not a valid integer"},
                {"key": "my_value", "message": "value is not a valid integer"}
              ]
            }

        .. code-block:: json

            {
              "status_code": 400,

                {"key": "int_header", "message": "value is not a valid integer", "source": "header"},
                {"key": "int_cookie", "message": "value is not a valid integer", "source": "cookie"},
              ]
            }

    .. change:: ``TestClient`` default timeout
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1840
        :breaking:

        A ``timeout`` parameter was added to

        - :class:`~litestar.testing.TestClient`
        - :class:`~litestar.testing.AsyncTestClient`
        - :class:`~litestar.testing.create_test_client`
        - :class:`~litestar.testing.create_async_test_client`

        The value is passed down to the underlying HTTPX client and serves as a default
        timeout for all requests.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy DTO: Explicit error messages when type annotations for a column are missing
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1852

        Replace the nondescript :exc:`KeyError` raised when a SQLAlchemy DTO is
        constructed from a model that is missing a type annotation for an included
        column with an :exc:`ImproperlyConfiguredException`, including an explicit error
        message, pointing at the potential cause.

    .. change:: Remove exception details from Internal Server Error responses
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1857
        :issue: 1856

        Error responses with a ``500`` status code will now always use
        `"Internal Server Error"` as default detail.

    .. change:: Pydantic v1 regex validation
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1865
        :issue: 1860

        A regression has been fixed in the pydantic signature model logic, which was
        caused by the renaming of ``regex`` to ``pattern``, which would lead to the
        :attr:`~litestar.params.KwargDefinition.pattern` not being validated.


.. changelog:: 2.0.0beta1
    :date: 2023/06/16

    .. change:: Expose ``ParsedType`` as public API
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1677, 1567

        Expose the previously private :class:`litestar.typing.ParsedType`. This is
        mainly indented for usage with
        :meth:`litestar.plugins.SerializationPluginProtocol.supports_type`

    .. change:: Improved debugging capabilities
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1742

        - A new ``pdb_on_exception`` parameter was added to
          :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar`. When set to ``True``, Litestar will drop into
          a the Python debugger when an exception occurs. It defaults to ``None``
        - When ``pdb_on_exception`` is ``None``, setting the environment variable
          ``LITESTAR_PDB=1`` can be used to enable this behaviour
        - When using the CLI, passing the ``--pdb`` flag to the ``run`` command will
          temporarily set the environment variable ``LITESTAR_PDB=1``

    .. change:: OpenAPI: Add `operation_class` argument to HTTP route handlers
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1732

        The ``operation_class`` argument was added to
        :class:`~litestar.handlers.HTTPRouteHandler` and the corresponding decorators,
        allowing to override the :class:`~litestar.openapi.spec.Operation` class, to

        :type: feature
        :pr: 1689

        A new ``--reload-dir`` option was added to the ``litestar run`` command. When
        used, ``--reload`` is implied, and the server will watch for changes in the
        given directory.

        When a handler returns a type that is not supported by the DTO, but:

        - the return type is generic
        - it has a generic type argument that is supported by the dto
        - the type argument maps to an attribute on the return type

        the DTO operations will be performed on the data retrieved from that attribute
        of the instance returned from the handler, and return the instance.

        The constraints are:

        - the type returned from the handler must be a type that litestar can
          natively encode
        - the annotation of the attribute that holds the data must be a type that DTOs

        :issue: 1674
        :pr: 1678

        App state can be created using ``deep_copy=False``, however state would still be
        deep copied for dependency injection.

        This was fixed memoizing the value of ``deep_copy`` when state is created, and
        reusing it on subsequent copies.

        When :class:`~litestar.typing.ParsedType` was introduced,
        :meth:`~litestar.typing.ParsedType.is_subclass_of` any union was deliberately
        left to return ``False`` with the intention of waiting for some use-cases to
        arrive.

        This behaviour was changed to address an issue where a handler may be typed to
        return a union of multiple response types; If all response types are
        :class:`~litestar.response.Response` subtypes then the correct response handler
        will now be applied.

        :pr: 1676

        Migrations generated for models with a

        ``length=16`` on the input.  Since this parameter is not defined in the type's
        the ``__init__`` method. This was fixed by adding the appropriate parameter to
        the type's signature.

        :pr: 1819
        :breaking:

        :class:`~litestar.handlers.BaseRouteHandler` was originally made generic to

    .. change:: Deprecation of ``Litestar`` parameter ``preferred_validation_backend``
        :pr: 1810
        :breaking:

        The following changes have been made regarding the
        ``preferred_validation_backend``:

        - The ``preferred_validation_backend`` parameter of
          :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar` has been renamed to
          ``_preferred_validation_backend`` and deprecated. It will be removed
          completely in a future version.
        - The ``Litestar.preferred_validation_backend`` attribute has been made private
        - The ``preferred_validation_backend`` attribute has been removed from
          :class:`~litestar.config.app.AppConfig`

        In addition, the logic for selecting a signature validation backend has been
        simplified as follows: If the preferred backend is set to ``attrs``, or the
        signature contains attrs types, ``attrs`` is selected. In all other cases,
        Pydantic will be used.

    .. change:: ``Response.get_serializer`` moved to ``serialization.get_serializer``
        :pr: 1820
        :breaking:


        The ``Response.get_serializer()`` method has been removed in favor of the
        :func:`~litestar.serialization.get_serializer` function.

        In the previous :class:`~litestar.response.Response` implementation,
        ``get_serializer()`` was called on the response inside the response's
        ``__init__``, and the merging of class-level ``type_encoders`` with the
        ``Response``\ 's ``type_encoders`` occurred inside its ``get_serializer``
        method.

        In the current version of ``Response``, the response body is not encoded until
        after the response object has been returned from the handler, and it is
        converted into a low-level :class:`~litestar.response.base.ASGIResponse` object.
        Due to this, there is still opportunity for the handler layer resolved
        ``type_encoders`` object to be merged with the ``Response`` defined
        ``type_encoders``, making the merge inside the ``Response`` no longer necessary.

        In addition, the separate ``get_serializer`` function greatly simplifies the
        interaction between middlewares and serializers, allowing to retrieve one
        independently from a ``Response``.

    .. change:: Remove response containers and introduce ``ASGIResponse``
        :pr: 1790
        :breaking:

        Response Containers were wrapper classes used to indicate the type of response
        returned by a handler, for example ``File``, ``Redirect``, ``Template`` and
        ``Stream`` types. These types abstracted the interface of responses from the
        underlying response itself.

        Response containers have been removed and their functionality largely merged with
        that of :class:`~litestar.response.Response`. The predefined response containers
        still exist functionally, as subclasses of
        :class:`Response <.response.Response>` and are now located within the
        :mod:`litestar.response` module.
        In addition to the functionality of Response containers, they now also feature
        all of the response's functionality, such as methods to add headers and cookies.

        The :class:`~litestar.response.Response` class now only serves as a wrapper and
        context object, and does not handle the data sending part, which has been
        delegated to a newly introduced
        :class:`ASGIResponse <.response.base.ASGIResponse>`. This type (and its
        subclasses) represent the response as an immutable object and are used
        internally by Litestar to perform the I/O operations of the response. These can
        be created and returned from handlers like any other ASGI application, however
        they are low-level, and lack the utility of the higher-level response types.



.. changelog:: 2.0.0alpha7

    .. change:: Warn about sync callables in route handlers and dependencies without an explicit ``sync_to_thread`` value
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1648, 1655

        A warning will now be raised when a synchronous callable is being used in an
        :class:`~.handlers.HTTPRouteHandler` or :class:`~.di.Provide`, without setting
        ``sync_to_thread``. This is to ensure that synchronous callables are handled
        properly, and to prevent accidentally using callables which might block the main
        thread.

        This warning can be turned off globally by setting the environment variable
        ``LITESTAR_WARN_IMPLICIT_SYNC_TO_THREAD=0``.

        ``on_accept``, ``on_disconnect`` and the ``connection_lifespan`` context
        manager. The ``socket`` parameter is therefore also not mandatory anymore in
        those callables.

    .. change:: Declaring dependencies without ``Provide``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1647

        Dependencies can now be declared without using :class:`~litestar.di.Provide`.
        The callables can be passed directly to the ``dependencies`` dictionary.


    .. change:: Add ``DTOData`` to receive unstructured but validated DTO data
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1650

        :class:`~litestar.dto.factory.DTOData` is a datastructure for interacting with
        DTO validated data in its unstructured form.

        This utility is to support the case where the amount of data that is available
        from the client request is not complete enough to instantiate an instance of the
        model that would otherwise be injected.


    .. change:: Partial DTOs
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1651

        Add a ``partial`` flag to :class:`~litestar.dto.factory.DTOConfig`, making all
        DTO fields options. Subsequently, any unset values will be filtered when

        This allows for example to use a to handle PATCH requests more easily.


    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: ``psycopg`` asyncio support
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1657

        Async `psycopg <https://www.psycopg.org/>`_ is now officially supported and
        tested for the SQLAlchemy repository.

        :pr: 1657

        On databases without native support for GUIDs,
        :class:`~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.types.GUID` will now fall back to
        ``BINARY(16)``.

    .. change:: Application lifespan context managers
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1635

        A new ``lifespan`` argument has been added to :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar`,
        accepting an asynchronous context manager, wrapping the lifespan of the
        application. It will be entered with the startup phase and exited on shutdown,
        providing functionality equal to the ``on_startup`` and ``on_shutdown`` hooks.

    .. change:: Unify application lifespan hooks: Remove ``before_`` and ``after_``
        :breaking:
        :type: feature

        The following application lifespan hooks have been removed:

        - ``before_startup``
        - ``after_startup``
        - ``before_shutdown``
        - ``after_shutdown``

        The remaining hooks ``on_startup`` and ``on_shutdown`` will now receive as their
        optional first argument the :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar` application instead
        of the application's state.

    .. change:: Trio-compatible event emitter
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1666

        The default :class:`~litestar.events.emitter.SimpleEventEmitter` is now

        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1649
        :issue: 1643

        A bug was fixed that would lead to name collisions in the OpenAPI schema when
        using DTOs with the same class name. DTOs now include a short 8 byte random
        string in their generated name to prevent this.

    .. change:: Fix validated attrs model being injected as a dictionary
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1668
        :issue: 1643

        :type: feature
        :pr: 1626

        Add support for `MessagePack <https://msgpack.org/index.html>`_ to the
        :class:`WebSocket <litestar.connection.WebSocket>` connection.

        Three new methods have been added for handling MessagePack:

        - :meth:`send_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.send_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`receive_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.receive_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`iter_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.iter_msgpack>`

        In addition, two MessagePack related methods were added to
        :class:`WebSocketTestSession <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession>`:

        - :meth:`send_msgpack <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession.send_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`receive_msgpack <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession.receive_msgpack>`

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add support for sentinel column
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1603

        This change adds support for ``sentinel column`` feature added in ``sqlalchemy``
        2.0.10. Without it, there are certain cases where ``add_many`` raises an
        exception.

        The ``_sentinel`` value added to the declarative base should be excluded from
        normal select operations automatically and is excluded in the ``to_dict``
        methods.

    .. change:: DTO: Alias generator for field names
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1590

        A new argument ``rename_strategy`` has been added to the :class:`DTOConfig <litestar.dto.factory.DTOConfig>`,

    .. change:: DTO: Nested field exclusion
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1596
        :issue: 1197

        This feature adds support for excluding nested model fields using dot-notation,
        e.g., ``"a.b"`` excludes field ``b`` from nested model field ``a``

    .. change:: WebSockets: Managing a socket's lifespan using a context manager in websocket listeners
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1625

        Changes the way a socket's lifespan - accepting the connection and calling the
        appropriate event hooks - to use a context manager.

        The ``connection_lifespan`` argument was added to the
        :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.websocket_listener>`, which accepts
        an asynchronous context manager, which can be used to handle the lifespan of
        the socket.

    .. change:: New module: Channels
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1587

        A new module :doc:`channels </usage/channels>` has been added: A general purpose

        Support OpenAPI schema generation for `attrs <https://www.attrs.org>`_ classes and
        `msgspec <https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/>`_ ``Struct``\ s.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add ``ModelProtocol``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1503

        Add a new class ``contrib.sqlalchemy.base.ModelProtocol``, serving as a generic model base type, allowing to
        specify custom base classes while preserving typing information

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Support MySQL/MariaDB
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add support for MySQL/MariaDB to the SQLAlchemy repository, using the
        `asyncmy <https://github.com/long2ice/asyncmy>`_ driver.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Support MySQL/MariaDB

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add matching logic to ``get_or_create``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add a ``match_fields`` argument to
        :meth:`SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository <litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.get_or_create>`.
        This lets you lookup a model using a subset of the kwargs you've provided. If the remaining kwargs are different
        from the retrieved model's stored values, an update is performed.

    .. change:: Repository: Extend filter types
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add new filters :class:`OrderBy <litestar.contrib.repository.filters.OrderBy>` and
        :class:`SearchFilter <litestar.contrib.repository.filters.SearchFilter>`, providing ``ORDER BY ...`` and
        ``LIKE ...`` / ``ILIKE ...`` clauses respectively

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Rename ``SQLAlchemyRepository`` > ``SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository``
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1345

        ``SQLAlchemyRepository`` has been renamed to
        :class:`SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository <litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository>`.


    .. change:: DTO: Add ``AbstractDTOFactory`` and backends
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1461

        An all-new DTO implementation was added, using ``AbstractDTOFactory`` as a base class, providing Pydantic and
        msgspec backends to facilitate (de)serialization and validation.

    .. change:: DTO: Remove ``from_connection`` / extend ``from_data``
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1500

        The method ``DTOInterface.from_connection`` has been removed and replaced by ``DTOInterface.from_bytes``, which
        receives both the raw bytes from the connection, and the connection instance. Since ``from_bytes`` now does not
        handle connections anymore, it can also be a synchronous method, improving symmetry with
        ``DTOInterface.from_bytes``.

        The signature of ``from_data`` has been changed to also accept the connection, matching ``from_bytes``'
        signature.

        As a result of these changes,
        :meth:`DTOInterface.from_bytes <litestar.dto.interface.DTOInterface.data_to_encodable_type>` no longer needs to
        receive the connection instance, so the ``request`` parameter has been dropped.

    .. change:: WebSockets: Support DTOs in listeners
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1518

        Support for DTOs has been added to :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.WebsocketListener>` and
        :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.websocket_listener>`. A ``dto`` and ``return_dto`` parameter has
        been added, providing the same functionality as their route handler counterparts.

    .. change:: DTO based serialization plugin
        :breaking:
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1501

        :class:`SerializationPluginProtocol <litestar.plugins.SerializationPluginProtocol>` has been re-implemented,
        leveraging the new :class:`DTOInterface <litestar.dto.interface.DTOInterface>`.

        If a handler defines a plugin supported type as either the ``data`` kwarg type annotation, or as the return
        annotation for a handler function, and no DTO has otherwise been resolved to handle the type, the protocol
        creates a DTO implementation to represent that type which is then used to de-serialize into, and serialize from
        instances of that supported type.

        .. important::
            The `Piccolo ORM <https://piccolo-orm.com/>`_ and `Tortoise ORM <https://tortoise.github.io/>`_ plugins have
            been removed by this change, but will be re-implemented using the new patterns in a future release leading
            up to the 2.0 release.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy 1 contrib module removed
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1501

        As a result of the changes introduced in `#1501 <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/pull/1501>`_,
        SQLAlchemy 1 support has been dropped.

        .. note::
            If you rely on SQLAlchemy 1, you can stick to Starlite *1.51* for now. In the future, a SQLAlchemy 1 plugin
            may be released as a standalone package.

    .. change:: Fix inconsistent parsing of unix timestamp between pydantic and cattrs
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1492
        :issue: 1491

        Timestamps parsed as :class:`date <datetime.date>` with pydantic return a UTC date, while cattrs implementation
        return a date with the local timezone.

        This was corrected by forcing dates to UTC when being parsed by attrs.

    .. change:: Fix: Retrieve type hints from class with no ``__init__`` method causes error
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1505
        :issue: 1504

        An error would occur when using a callable without an :meth:`object.__init__` method was used in a placed that
        would cause it to be inspected (such as a route handler's signature).

        This was caused by trying to access the ``__module__`` attribute of :meth:`object.__init__`, which would fail
        with

        .. code-block::

            'wrapper_descriptor' object has no attribute '__module__'

    .. change:: Fix error raised for partially installed attrs dependencies
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1543

        An error was fixed that would cause a :exc:`MissingDependencyException` to be raised when dependencies for
        `attrs <https://www.attrs.org>`_ were partially installed. This was fixed by being more specific about the
        missing dependencies in the error messages.

    .. change:: Change ``MissingDependencyException`` to be a subclass of ``ImportError``
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1557

        :exc:`MissingDependencyException` is now a subclass of :exc:`ImportError`, to make handling cases where both
        of them might be raised easier.

    .. change:: Remove bool coercion in URL parsing
        :breaking:
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1550
        :issue: 1547

        When defining a query parameter as ``param: str``, and passing it a string value of ``"true"``, the value
        received by the route handler was the string ``"True"``, having been title cased. The same was true for the value
        of ``"false"``.

        This has been fixed by removing the coercing of boolean-like values during URL parsing and leaving it up to
        the parsing utilities of the receiving side (i.e. the handler's signature model) to handle these values
        according to the associated type annotations.

    .. change:: Update ``standard`` and ``full`` package extras
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1494

        - Add SQLAlchemy, uvicorn, attrs and structlog to the ``full`` extra
        - Add uvicorn to the ``standard`` extra
        - Add ``uvicorn[standard]`` as an optional dependency to be used in the extras

    .. change:: Remove support for declaring DTOs as handler types
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1534

        Prior to this, a DTO type could be declared implicitly using type annotations. With the addition of the ``dto``
        and ``return_dto`` parameters, this feature has become superfluous and, in the spirit of offering only one clear
        way of doing things, has been removed.

    .. change:: Fix missing ``content-encoding`` headers on gzip/brotli compressed files
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1577
        :issue: 1576

        Fixed a bug that would cause static files served via ``StaticFilesConfig`` that have been compressed with gripz
        or brotli to miss the appropriate ``content-encoding`` header.

    .. change:: DTO: Simplify ``DTOConfig``
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1580

        - The ``include`` parameter has been removed, to provide a more accessible interface and avoid overly complex
          interplay with ``exclude`` and its support for dotted attributes
        - ``field_mapping`` has been renamed to ``rename_fields`` and support to remap field types has been dropped
        - experimental ``field_definitions`` has been removed. It may be replaced with a "ComputedField" in a future
          release that will allow multiple field definitions to be added to the model, and a callable that transforms
          them into a value for a model field. See

    .. change:: Update logging levels when setting ``Litestar.debug`` dynamically
        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1476
        :pr: 1482

        When passing ``debug=True`` to :class:`Litestar <litestar.app.Litestar>`, the ``litestar`` logger would be set
        up in debug mode, but changing the ``debug`` attribute after the class had been instantiated did not update the
        logger accordingly.

        This lead to a regression where the ``--debug`` flag to the CLI's ``run`` command would no longer have the
        desired affect, as loggers would still be on the ``INFO`` level.

    .. change:: Support setting status codes in ``Redirect`` container
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1412
        :issue: 1371

        Add support for manually setting status codes in the
        :class:`RedirectResponse <litestar.response_containers.Redirect>` response container.
        This was previously only possible by setting the ``status_code`` parameter on
        the corresponding route handler, making dynamic redirect status codes and
        conditional redirects using this container hard to implement.

        to a route handlers ``cache argument``, will cause it to be cached forever, skipping the default expiration.

        Additionally, add support for setting
        :attr:`ResponseCacheConfig.default_expiration <litestar.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig>` to ``None``,
        allowing to cache values indefinitely by default when setting ``cache=True`` on a route handler.

    .. change:: `Accept`-header parsing and content negotiation

        Add an :attr:`accept <litestar.connection.Request.accept>` property to
        :class:`Request <litestar.connection.Request>`, returning the newly added
        :class:`Accept <litestar.datastructures.headers.Accept>` header wrapper, representing the requests ``Accept``
        HTTP header, offering basic content negotiation.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy 1 plugin mutates app state destructively
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1391
        :issue: 1368

        When using the SQLAlchemy 1 plugin, repeatedly running through the application lifecycle (as done when testing
        an application not provided by a factory function), would result in a :exc:`KeyError` on the second pass.

        This was caused be the plugin's ``on_shutdown`` handler deleting the ``engine_app_state_key`` from the
        application's state on application shutdown, but only adding it on application init.

        This was fixed by adding performing the necessary setup actions on application startup rather than init.

    .. change:: Fix SQLAlchemy 1 Plugin - ``'Request' object has no attribute 'dict'``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1389
        :issue: 1388

        An annotation such as

        .. code-block:: python

            async def provide_user(request: Request[User, Token, Any]) -> User:
                ...

        would result in the error ``'Request' object has no attribute 'dict'``.

        This was fixed by changing how ``get_plugin_for_value`` interacts with :func:`typing.get_args`

    .. change:: Support OpenAPI schema generation with stringized return annotation
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1410
        :issue: 1409

        The following code would result in non-specific and incorrect information being generated for the OpenAPI schema:

        .. code-block:: python

            from __future__ import annotations

            from starlite import Starlite, get


            @get("/")
            def hello_world() -> dict[str, str]:
                return {"hello": "world"}

        This could be alleviated by removing ``from __future__ import annotations``. Stringized annotations in any form
        are now fully supported.

        :type: bugfix

        When using a model that includes a type annotation with :class:`typing.Annotated` in a route handler, the
        interactive documentation would raise an error when accessed. This has been fixed and :class:`typing.Annotated`
        is now fully supported.

.. changelog:: 2.0.0alpha2

    .. change:: Repository contrib & SQLAlchemy repository
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1254

        Add a a ``repository`` module to ``contrib``, providing abstract base classes
        to implement the repository pattern. Also added was the ``contrib.repository.sqlalchemy``
        module, implementing a SQLAlchemy repository, offering hand-tuned abstractions
        over commonly used tasks, such as handling of object sessions, inserting,
        updating and upserting individual models or collections.

    .. change:: Data stores & registry
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1330
        :breaking:

        The ``starlite.storage`` module added in the previous version has been
        renamed ``starlite.stores`` to reduce ambiguity, and a new feature, the
        ``starlite.stores.registry.StoreRegistry`` has been introduced;
        It serves as a central place to manage stores and reduces the amount of
        configuration needed for various integrations.

        - Add ``stores`` kwarg to ``Starlite`` and ``AppConfig`` to allow seeding of the ``StoreRegistry``
        - Add ``Starlite.stores`` attribute, containing a ``StoreRegistry``
        - Change ``RateLimitMiddleware`` to use ``app.stores``
        - Change request caching to use ``app.stores``
        - Change server side sessions to use ``app.stores``
        - Move ``starlite.config.cache.CacheConfig`` to  ``starlite.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig``
        - Rename ``Starlite.cache_config`` > ``Starlite.response_cache_config``
        - Rename ``AppConfig.cache_config`` > ``response_cache_config``
        - Remove ``starlite/cache`` module
        - Remove ``ASGIConnection.cache`` property
        - Remove ``Starlite.cache`` attribute

        .. attention::
            ``starlite.middleware.rate_limit.RateLimitMiddleware``,
            ``starlite.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig``,
            and ``starlite.middleware.session.server_side.ServerSideSessionConfig``
            instead of accepting a ``storage`` argument that could be passed a ``Storage`` instance now have to be
            configured via the ``store`` attribute, accepting a string key for the store to be used from the registry.
            The ``store`` attribute has a unique default set, guaranteeing a unique
            ``starlite.stores.memory.MemoryStore`` instance is acquired for every one of them from the
            registry by default

        Update the CLI :ref:`usage/cli:autodiscovery` to only consider canonical modules app and application, but every
        ``starlite.app.Starlite`` instance or application factory able to return a ``Starlite`` instance within
        those or one of their submodules, giving priority to the canonical names app and application for application
        objects and submodules containing them.

        Add three new configuration options to ``starlite.logging.config.BaseLoggingConfig``:

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.log_exceptions``
            Configure when exceptions are logged.

            ``always``
                Always log exceptions

            ``debug``
                Log exceptions in debug mode only

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.traceback_line_limit``
            Configure how many lines of tracback are logged

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.exception_logging_handler``
            A callable that receives three parameters - the ``app.logger``, the connection scope and the traceback
            list, and should handle logging

        An error would be raised when using the SQLAlchemy plugin with a
        `sqlalchemy UUID <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.UUID>`_. This

    .. change:: Update ``SimpleEventEmitter`` to use worker pattern
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1346

        ``starlite.events.emitter.SimpleEventEmitter`` was updated to using an async worker, pulling
        emitted events from a queue and subsequently calling listeners. Previously listeners were called immediately,
        making the operation effectively "blocking".

        argument, accepting an optional ``starlite.datastructures.state.State`` instance.

        Existing code using this keyword argument will need to be changed from

        from an ``starlite.config.app.AppConfig`` instance.

    .. change:: Web concurrency option for CLI ``run`` command
        :pr: 1218
        :type: feature

        A ``--wc`` / --web-concurrency` option was added to the ``starlite run`` command,

    .. change:: Validation of ``state`` parameter in handler functions
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1264

        Type annotations of the reserved ``state`` parameter in handler functions will
        now be validated such that annotations using an unsupported type will raise a
        ``starlite.exceptions.ImproperlyConfiguredException``.

    .. change:: Generic application state
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1030

        ``starlite.connection.base.ASGIConnection`` and its subclasses are now generic on ``State``
        which allow to to fully type hint a request as ``Request[UserType, AuthType, StateType]``.

    .. change:: Dependency injection of classes

        Storage backends for server-side sessions ``starlite.cache.Cache``` have been unified and replaced
        by the ``starlite.storages``, which implements generic asynchronous key/values stores backed
        by memory, the file system or redis.

        .. important::
            This is a breaking change and you need to change your session / cache configuration accordingly


    .. change:: Relaxed type annotations
        :pr: 1140
        :type: misc

        Type annotations across the library have been relaxed to more generic forms, for example
        ``Iterable[str]`` instead of ``List[str]`` or ``Mapping[str, str]`` instead of ``Dict[str, str]``.

    .. change:: ``type_encoders`` support in ``AbstractSecurityConfig``
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1167

        ``type_encoders`` support has been added to

        :breaking:

        The plugin protocol has been split into three distinct protocols, covering different use cases:

        ``starlite.plugins.InitPluginProtocol``
            Hook into an application's initialization process

        ``starlite.plugins.SerializationPluginProtocol``
            Extend the serialization and deserialization capabilities of an application

        ``starlite.plugins.OpenAPISchemaPluginProtocol``

        same interface, along with the ``headers`` and ``cookies`` keyword arguments to
        ``starlite.response.Response``. They each allow to pass either a
        `:class:`Mapping[str, str] <typing.Mapping>`, e.g. a dictionary, or a :class:`Sequence <typing.Sequence>` of
        ``starlite.datastructures.response_header.ResponseHeader`` or

        :pr: 1242

        Several Pydantic models used for configuration have been replaced with dataclasses or plain classes. This change
        should be mostly non-breaking, unless you relied on those configuration objects being Pydantic models. The changed

        :type: misc
        :breaking:

    .. change:: Cleanup of the ``starlite`` namespace
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1135

        The ``starlite`` namespace has been cleared up, removing many names from it, which now have to be imported from
        their respective submodules individually. This was both done to improve developer experience as well as reduce
        the time it takes to ``import starlite``.

        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1191

              { "type": null" },
              { "oneOf": [] }
             ]}


    .. change:: Fix ``LoggingMiddleware`` is sending obfuscated session id to client
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1228

        ``LoggingMiddleware`` would in some cases send obfuscated data to the client, due to a bug in the obfuscation
        function which obfuscated values in the input dictionary in-place.

        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1223

        cookie.

        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1201

        A validation error made it impossible to serve static files from the root path ``/`` .

        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1149

        A middleware's ``exclude`` parameter would sometimes not be honoured if the path was used to serve static files
        using ``StaticFilesConfig``.
