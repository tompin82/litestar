Benchmarks
==========

Methodology
-----------

-  Benchmarking is done using the `bombardier <https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier>`__ benchmarking tool.
-  Benchmarks are run on a dedicated machine, with a base Debian 11 installation.
-  Each framework is contained within its own docker container, running on a dedicated CPU core (using the ``cset shield`` command and the ``--cpuset-cpus`` option for docker)
-  Tests for the frameworks are written to make them as comparable as possible while completing the same tasks (you can see them `here <https://github.com/litestar-org/api-performance-tests/tree/main/frameworks>`__)
-  Each application is run using `uvicorn <https://www.uvicorn.org/>`__ with **one worker** and `uvloop <https://uvloop.readthedocs.io/>`__
-  Test data has been randomly generated and is being imported from a shared module

Results
-------

..  note::
    If a result is missing for a specific framework that means either

    - It does not support this functionality (this will be mentioned in the test description)
    - More than 0.1% of responses were dropped / erroneous

Path and query parameter handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*All responses return “No Content”*

-  No params: No path parameters
-  Path params: Single path parameter, coerced into an integer
-  Query params: Single query parameter, coerced into an integer
-  Mixed params: A path and a query parameters, coerced into integers

Dependency injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*(not supported by* ``Starlette`` *)*

-  Resolving 3 nested synchronous dependencies
-  Resolving 3 nested asynchronous dependencies (only supported by ``Litestar`` and ``FastAPI``)
-  Resolving 3 nested synchronous, and 3 nested asynchronous dependencies (only supported by ``Litestar`` and ``FastAPI``)

Interpreting the results
------------------------

An interpretation of these results should be approached with caution, as is the case for nearly all benchmarks.
A high score in a test does not necessarily translate to high performance of **your** application in **your** use case.
For almost any test you can probably write an app that performs better or worse at a comparable task **in your scenario**.

While trying to design the tests in a way that simulate somewhat realistic scenarios, they can never give an exact
representation of how a real world application, where, aside from the workload, many other factors come into play.
These tests were mainly written to be used internally for litestar development, to help us locate the source of some
performance regression we were experiencing.
