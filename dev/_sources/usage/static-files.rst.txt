Static Files
============

Static files are served by the app from predefined locations. To configure static file serving, either pass an
instance of :class:`StaticFilesConfig <.static_files.config.StaticFilesConfig>` or a list
thereof to :class:`Litestar <.app.Litestar>` using the ``static_files_config`` kwarg.

For example, lets say our Litestar app is going to serve **regular files** from the ``my_app/static`` folder and **html
documents** from the ``my_app/html`` folder, and we would like to serve the **static files** on the ``/files`` path,
and the **html files** on the ``/html`` path:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar import Litestar
   from litestar.static_files.config import StaticFilesConfig

   app = Litestar(
       route_handlers=[...],
       static_files_config=[
           StaticFilesConfig(directories=["static"], path="/files"),
           StaticFilesConfig(directories=["html"], path="/html", html_mode=True),
       ],
   )

Matching is done based on filename, for example, assume we have a request that is trying to retrieve the path
``/files/file.txt``\ , the **directory for the base path** ``/files`` **will be searched** for the file ``file.txt``. If it is
found, the file will be sent, otherwise a **404 response** will be sent.

If ``html_mode`` is enabled and no specific file is requested, the application will fall back to serving ``index.html``. If
no file is found the application will look for a ``404.html`` file in order to render a response, otherwise a 404
:class:`NotFoundException <.exceptions.http_exceptions.NotFoundException>` will be returned.

You can provide a ``name`` parameter to ``StaticFilesConfig`` to identify the given config and generate links to files in
folders belonging to that config. ``name`` should be a unique string across all static configs and
`route handlers <usage/route-handlers:Route Handler Indexing>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar import Litestar
   from litestar.static_files.config import StaticFilesConfig

   app = Litestar(
       route_handlers=[...],
       static_files_config=[
           StaticFilesConfig(
               directories=["static"], path="/some_folder/static/path", name="static"
           ),
       ],
   )

   url_path = app.url_for_static_asset("static", "file.pdf")
   # /some_folder/static/path/file.pdf

Sending files as attachments
----------------------------

By default, files are sent "inline", meaning they will have a ``Content-Disposition: inline`` header.
To send them as attachments, use the ``send_as_attachment=True`` flag, which will add a
``Content-Disposition: attachment`` header:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar import Litestar
   from litestar.static_files.config import StaticFilesConfig

   app = Litestar(
       route_handlers=[...],
       static_files_config=[
           StaticFilesConfig(
               directories=["static"],
               path="/some_folder/static/path",
               name="static",
               send_as_attachment=True,
           ),
       ],
   )

File System support and Cloud Files
-----------------------------------

The :class:`StaticFilesConfig <.static_files.StaticFilesConfig>` class accepts a value called ``file_system``,
which can be any class adhering to the Litestar :class:`FileSystemProtocol <litestar.types.FileSystemProtocol>`.

This protocol is similar to the file systems defined by `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
which cover all major cloud providers and a wide range of other use cases (e.g. HTTP based file service, ``ftp``, etc.).

In order to use any file system, simply use `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or one of
the libraries based upon it, or provide a custom implementation adhering to the
:class:`FileSystemProtocol <litestar.types.FileSystemProtocol>`.
