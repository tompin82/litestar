JWT Security Backends
=====================

Litestar offers optional JWT based security backends. To use these make sure to install the ``python-jose``
and ``cryptography`` packages, or simply install Litestar with the jwt extra: ``pip install litestar[jwt]``.

JWT Auth Backend
----------------

This is the base JWT Auth backend. You can read about its particular API in
the :class:`API Reference <litestar.contrib.jwt.JWTAuth>`. It sends the JWT token using a header - and it expects requests to
send the JWT token using the same header key.

JWT Cookie Auth Backend
-----------------------

This backend inherits from the :class:`JWTAuth <litestar.contrib.jwt.JWTAuth>` backend, with the difference being that instead
of using a header for the JWT Token, it uses a cookie.

OAuth2 Bearer Password Flow
---------------------------

This backend inherits from the :class:`JWTCookieAuth <litestar.contrib.jwt.JWTCookieAuth>` backend. It works similarly to
the ``JWTCookieAuth`` backend, but is meant to be used for OAUTH2 Bearer password flows.
